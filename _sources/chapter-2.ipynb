    "(a) Consider a matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ with $m$ rows and $n$ columns, and two bases $\\mathbf{B}_1$ and $\\mathbf{B}_2$. Assume that both basic solutions are non-degenerate, meaning that all $m$ variables in the basic solution corresponding to basis $\\mathbf{B}_1$ are non-zero, and all $m$ variables in the basic solution corresponding to basis $\\mathbf{B}_2$ are also non-zero. Since the two bases are different, there is at least one variable that is in $\\mathbf{B}_1$ but not in $\\mathbf{B}_2$, which leads to $m+1$ non-zero variables in the solution $\\mathbf{x}$. This contradicts the fact that $\\mathbf{x}$ is a basic solution. Therefore, the basic solution $\\mathbf{x}$ must be degenerate.\n",
